## Question 4 â€“ Cybersecurity Awareness Certification

A cybersecurity awareness program certifies participants who have either:  
- Attended **all five sessions**, or  
- Scored at least **80%** in the final test.  

### Task  
Write a program that:  
1. Takes the number of sessions attended and the final test score as input from the user.  
2. Prints `"Certified"` if the participant meets **either** criterion, and `"Not Certified"` otherwise.
