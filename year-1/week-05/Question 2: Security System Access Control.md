## Question 2 – Security System Access Control

Suppose you are building part of a security system for a data center.  

- All employees can access the server room **between 9 AM and 5 PM** (i.e., 09:00–17:00).  
- **Only Managers or Administrators** can access the server room **after 6 PM**.  

### Task  
Write a program that:  
1. Asks the user to specify their role (e.g., `"employee"`, `"manager"`, `"admin"`).  
2. Asks the user to enter the current time in hours (24-hour format).  
3. Prints `"Access Granted"` or `"Access Denied"` based on the rules above.
