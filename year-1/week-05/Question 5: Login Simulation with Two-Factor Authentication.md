## Question 5 â€“ Login Simulation with Two-Factor Authentication

Simulate a login process where:  
- A correct **username** and **password** must be entered, and  
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** must be successful.  

### Task  
Write a program that:  
1. Requests the user to enter their **username**, **password**, and whether the **2FA was successful**.  
2. Uses **hardcoded values** for the username and password:  
   - Username: `"admin"`  
   - Password: `"admin000"`  
3. Displays `"Login Successful"` if all conditions are met, otherwise displays `"Access Denied"`.
