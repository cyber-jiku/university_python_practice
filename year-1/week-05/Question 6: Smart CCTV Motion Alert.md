## Question 6 â€“ Smart CCTV Motion Alert

A smart CCTV system sends an alert when:  
- **Motion is detected**, and  
- The time is **after 10 PM** (22:00).  

### Task  
Write a program that:  
1. Takes **motion detection status** (True/False) and **current time** (in 24-hour format) as input from the user.  
2. Prints `"Motion Alert: Possible intrusion"` if both conditions are met, otherwise prints `"All clear"`.
