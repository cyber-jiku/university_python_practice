Python Labsheet Exercises

This repository contains solutions to Python labsheet exercises aimed at helping me design and implement simple programs. The exercises focus on:

Using variables, expressions, and assignment statements.

Applying programming concepts in simple, real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Developing problem abstraction and problem-solving skills.

Notes

All programs are written in Python (unless specified for RoboMind).

I have used meaningful variable names to describe the data they store.

Comments are included in the code to explain what each part does.

Programs have been tested with different inputs to ensure correctness.

All outputs are displayed with clear labels.
