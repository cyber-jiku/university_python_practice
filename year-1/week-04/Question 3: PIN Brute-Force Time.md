## 🔢 Question 3 – PIN Brute-Force Time

A 6-digit PIN has **10⁶** possible combinations.  
If an attacker can try `X` guesses per second, calculate the maximum time in hours required to crack it.  

📌 **Task:**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Asks the user to enter the number of guesses per second (`X`)  
- Calculates and displays the maximum time (in hours) required to try all possible combinations
