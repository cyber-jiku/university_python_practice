# 🧮 Computing with Numbers

These exercises are designed to help you practice designing and implementing simple **Python** programs that work with numeric values.  
You'll use **variables**, **expressions**, and other basic programming constructs while improving your ability to break problems down into clear, abstract steps.  

## 📌 Notes
- 🐍 All solutions must be written in **Python**  
- ✏️ Use **clear and meaningful variable names** for better readability  
- 🧠 Focus on problem-solving and logical thinking
